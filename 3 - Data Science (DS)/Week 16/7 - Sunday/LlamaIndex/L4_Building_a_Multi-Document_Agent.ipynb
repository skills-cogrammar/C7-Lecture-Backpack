Models like ChatGPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude 2, and SWE-Llama were evaluated on this dataset, each with different context limits. The performance of these models was assessed based on their ability to resolve issues using BM25 retrieval and the \"oracle\" retrieval setting. The dataset is designed to be challenging and realistic for evaluating language models in the context of software engineering tasks.\n"
