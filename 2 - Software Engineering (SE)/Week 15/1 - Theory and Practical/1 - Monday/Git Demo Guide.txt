** Open Terminal in Visual Studio <View / Terminal / Ctrl + `(~-key)

===========  Adding Local Repository
-- Initialising a git repository
★ To initialise a git repository in our desired root folder (Choose any folder, ie. gitdemo), run the git init command.
> git init

-- Git Status
★ After initialisation, we can use git status command to check what git is watching.
> git status

==> At this point the files in the directory will be listed, but if we change the content,
	the changes will not be reported since the changes are not being monitored yet.
	
-- Add files to the project, ie. add-file.txt

Adding a file to the Staging Environment. We can also call this the monitoring environment.
★ To add a file to the staging environment, we use the git add command.
> git add <filename>			# to add all files, use > git add .
> git status

-- Make changes to the files by editing with any editor and add or delete files if you want.

-- Creating a Commit
★ To create a commit, run the git commit -m “message about commit” command.
> git commit -m "This is my commit git status"

==> Now the above can just stay a local repository or you can add it as a remote repository

===========  Adding NEW Remote Repository
# Do the commands above to create the local repository

ie.

> git init
> git add
> git commit


To upload a new local repository to GitHub, you can follow these steps:

-- Create a Repository on GitHub:

★ Go to GitHub and log in to your account.
Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository."
Fill in the repository name (my-repo), description, and other options.
Click the "Create repository" button.


-- Link Local Repository to GitHub:
★ In your local repository, link it to the GitHub repository you just created:

> git remote add origin <repository_url>

-- Push Changes to GitHub:
★ Push your local repository to GitHub using the following commands:

**# Skip git branch command if your default branch is already named "main" *** 
> git branch -M main  # If your default branch is not named "main"
> git push -u origin main  --> This should bring a fatal error if files and changes were added to the local rep already.

*** 
The "fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories" error occurs when Git detects that the history of the local and remote repositories 
have no common commit, often due to the local and remote repositories being initialized independently. 
To address this, you can allow unrelated histories to be merged by using the --allow-unrelated-histories option.
***

> git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
> git push origin main 

★ Verify on GitHub:
Refresh the GitHub page for your repository, and you should see your code and commits reflected.

If you have access issues when pushing to GitHub

====== Link for login issues
https://cli.github.com/

★ Download and install the .msi on this page link

login command: > gh auth login
logout command: > gh auth logout

*** There are times where logout does not work: Run > gh auth setup-git

===========  To make changes to existing Remote Repository

★ To make changes to a remote repository, we want the repository to look like a folder.
★ First choose a folder on your pc (\Workspace)

Clone the Repository:
★ Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the remote repository and run the following command:
> git clone <repository_url>     --> ie. https://github.com/riaandeventer-cogrammar/my-repo
Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL you copied.

Enter Repository Directory:
★ Change into the newly cloned repository's directory 
(This new folder would have been created in the folder where you were when you did the clone):

> cd <repository_directory>
Replace <repository_directory> with the name of the repository's directory.

★ While in this folder, we now need to give an alias to the remote repository address
> git remote add origin <repository_url.git>		--> origin can be your choice, ie. my-remote

==> At this point the files in the directory will be listed, but if we change the content,
	the changes will not be reported since the changes are not being monitored yet.
	
Adding a file to the Staging Environment. We can also call this the monitoring environment.
★ To add a file to the staging environment, we use the git add command.
> git status

Make changes to the files by editing with any editor and add or delete files if you want.
* Read in the status report of your changes will be applied if you commit.
* If not staged, use below command:

> git add <filename>			# to add all files, use > git add .

Creating a Commit
★ To create a commit, run the git commit -m “message about commit” command.
> git commit -m "This is my commit git status"

Pushing changes from the local repository on your pc to the remote repository
★ To do this, we need to use the > git push
> git push origin main

===========  Create Conflict between the Local and Remote Repository

* Make Changes - Add '- Contradict Local' to Local Repository File and '- Contradict Remote' to Remote Repository file.
> git add . -> To add to staging area
> git commit -m "Add Contradict Local to file"
> git push origin main

--> The above push should request resolution of file conflict.

If VS Code Conflict Resolve does not open, then use > git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

--> Choose Popup 'Resolve in Merge Editor'
Update the Result Section to which resolution you want..
--> Choose 'Complete Merge' Button

> git commit -m "Resolve Conflict"
> git push origin main
--> Refresh Remote GitHub to see the changes if the local was the resolution

===== Cheat Sheet

https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf
 

====== Stashing changes if we want to change branches without committing changes

The stash is stored locally on your machine, so if you switch off your PC, 
the stash will still be available when you turn it back on. 
Git stashes are saved within the repository's .git directory.

== Stash Changes:

> git stash save "Your stash message"

== Switch Branch:

> git checkout <other-branch>

== Apply Stashed Changes:

git stash apply stash@{0}
Replace {0} with the appropriate stash index if you have multiple stashes.

== Drop Stash (Optional):

git stash drop stash@{0}
If you have already applied the changes and no longer need the stash.

== Clear All Stashes (Optional):

> git stash clear
If you want to remove all stashes.
